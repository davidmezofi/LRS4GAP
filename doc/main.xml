<Index>GLRS4GAP package</Index>
This chapter  describes  the  &GAP;  package  &GLRS4GAP;.  This package implements
functionalities for divisors and Riemann-Roch spaces of an algebraic function field of
genus zero.
<P/>

If you are viewing this with on-line help, type:
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[

<P/>
to see the functions provided by the &GLRS4GAP; package.<P/>

<Section Label="Unpacking the GLRS4GAP Package">
<Heading>Unpacking the &GLRS4GAP; Package</Heading>

If the &GLRS4GAP; package was obtained as a part of the &GAP; distribution
from the <Q>Download</Q> section of the &GAP; website, you may proceed
to Section <Ref Sect="Compiling Binaries of the GLRS4GAP Package"/>.
Alternatively, the &GLRS4GAP; package may be installed using a separate archive,
for example, for an update or an installation in a non-default location
(see <Ref Sect="GAP Root Directories" BookName="ref"/>).
<P/>

Below we describe the installation procedure for the <File>.tar.gz</File>
archive format. Installation using other archive formats is performed in a
similar way.
<P/>

To install the &GLRS4GAP; package, unpack the archive file, which  should
have a name of form <C>GLRS4GAP-<A>XXX</A>.tar.gz</C> for some version number
<A>XXX</A>, by typing
<P/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<C>gzip -dc GLRS4GAP-<A>XXX</A>.tar.gz | tar xpv</C>
<P/>

It may be unpacked in one of the following locations:
<List>
<Item>
in the <File>pkg</File> directory of your &GAP;&nbsp;4 installation;
</Item>
<Item>
or in a directory named <File>.gap/pkg</File> in your home directory
(to be added to the &GAP; root directory unless &GAP; is started with
<C>-r</C> option);
</Item>
<Item>
or in a directory named <File>pkg</File> in another directory of your
choice (e.g.&nbsp;in the directory <File>mygap</File> in your home
directory).
</Item>
</List>

In the latter case one one must start &GAP; with the <C>-l</C> option,
e.g.&nbsp;if your private <F>pkg</F> directory is a subdirectory of
<F>mygap</F> in your home directory you might type:
<P/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<C>gap -l ";<A>myhomedir</A>/mygap"</C>
<P/>
where <A>myhomedir</A> is the  path  to  your  home  directory,  which  (since
&GAP;&nbsp;4.3) may be replaced  by  a  tilde (the  empty  path  before  the
semicolon is  filled  in  by  the  default  path  of  the  &GAP;&nbsp;4  home
directory).

<Heading>Loading the &GLRS4GAP; Package</Heading>

To use the &GLRS4GAP; Package you have to request it explicitly. This  is
done by calling <Ref Func="LoadPackage" BookName="ref"/>:
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[
gap> LoadPackage("GLRS4GAP");
----------------------------------------------------------------
Loading  GLRS4GAP 0.1
by Gábor P. Nagy (http://www.math.u-szeged.hu/~nagyg)
For help, type: ?GLRS4GAP package
----------------------------------------------------------------
true
]]></Example>
<P/>

If &GAP; cannot find a working binary, the call  to  <C>LoadPackage</C>  will
still succeed but a warning is issued informing that  the  <C>HelloWorld()</C>
function will be unavailable.
<P/>
If you want to load the &GLRS4GAP; package by default, you  can  put  the
<C>LoadPackage</C> command  into  your  <F>gaprc</F>  file
(see  Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="The gap.ini and gaprc files" BookName="ref"/>).
