##  An auto company manufactures cars and trucks. Each vehicle must be processed in
##  the paint shop and body assembly shop. If the paint shop were only painting
##  trucks, then 40 per day could be painted. If the paint shop were only painting
##  cars, then 60 per day could be painted. If the body shop were only producing
##  cars, then it could process 50 per day.  If the body shop were only producing
##  trucks, then it could process 50 per day. Each truck contributes $300 to
##  profit, and each car contributes $200 to profit. Use linear programming to
##  determine a daily production schedule that will maximize the companyâ€™s profits.
